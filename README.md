# ShareDocks

## About

ShareDocks is an Android application meant for people who commute using a station-based bike share system.

The app detects when the user starts biking, and it notifies them when any of their tracked stations becomes unavailable due to all docks being taken or any other service interruption

## Features

- Get notifications whenever a tracked station becomes full
  - With a follow up notification if it is not full anymore
- Supports systems from more than 200 cities around the globe. [Full list](info/city_list.csv)
- Sends voice notifications so that the user doesn't need to check the phone while biking
- Detects automatically when biking starts (Thanks to the Android Activity Recognition Service)
